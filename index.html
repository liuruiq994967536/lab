        <h1>Keeping animals out of shelters though direct home placement</h1>
        <p>ABOUT THE PROGRAM
            Home To Home™ is an interactive platform created to help families, people, and pets with the difficult task of transitioning pets from one home to another. Oftentimes pets are taken to shelters when keeping a pet is no longer a possibility. Home To Home™ believes that pets should avoid a stay in an animal shelter and should instead be welcomed into loving homes.
